Gentlemen, it is me duty
To inform you of one beauty,
Though I'd ask you of a favour not to seek her for a while.
Though I know she is a creature
Of character and feature,
No word can paint the picture
Of the Queen of all Argyll!
***
And if you could have seen of her,
Boys, if you could just been there!
The swan was in her movement and the morning in her smile.
All the roses in the garden -
They bow an ask her pardon,
For no one could match the beauty
Of the Queen of all Argyll!

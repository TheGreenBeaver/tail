No word can paint the picture
Of the Queen of all Argyll!
***
And if you could have seen of her,
Boys, if you could just been there!
The swan was in her movement and the morning in her smile.
All the roses in the garden -
They bow an ask her pardon,
For no one could match the beauty
Of the Queen of all Argyll!

Of submarines
So we sailed
Onto the sun
Till we found
A sea of green
And we lived
Beneath the waves
In our yellow
Submarine
